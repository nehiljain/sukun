Some guidelines to follow:

1. If the diff is adding new feature, then it is a feature.
2. If the diff is improving performance, making code more maintainable or cleaner, better error handling, enhance clarity, flexibility, etc. then it is a refactor.
3. If the diff is updating docs/ipynb/md/code comments, then it is a documentation change.
4. Think critically and chose the type that reflects the majority or highest impact type of commits/changes.
5. If the commit/pr title has mention of fixing something in it. Then you should use the type as fix.
6. If the commit/pr title has mention of docs in it. Then you should use the type as docs.

1. feature

7. Include any images from both eng and user version in appropriate sections.
8. Keep the word count per update as low as possible. Write crisp and information dense sentences.
